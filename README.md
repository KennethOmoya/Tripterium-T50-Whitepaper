# Tripterium T50 Whitepaper
Tripterium T50 is a tokenized, closed-end index fund (CEF), which passively tracks the top fifty cryptocurrency assets by market capitalisation, in order to deliver healthy returns. The fund has a Venture Capital Feeder Fund, which will invest in expertly-vetted early stage blockchain technology companies that are seeking to undertake an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), therefore benefitting from the ICO returns.

Profits from the Tripterium Venture Capital Feeder Fund will provide a constant stream of new money coming into the Tripterium T50 index fund, increasing the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the portfolio to the benefit of the T50 token holders.

The Tripterium T50 token is an Ethereum ERC20 standard token that represents the holder’s ownership in the fund. The value of the T50 token is always backed by the Net Asset Value of the fund. A liquidation option that can be exercised via the smart contract, guarantees a minimum value for each T50 token based on its proportion of the NAV.

Cryptocurrencies are one of the most important inventions since the inception of the web. They are ushering in a new era of decentralization, privacy, and control of one’s own data that has the potential to revolutionize many parts of society. There are currently over one thousand cryptocurrencies in use, with hundreds more being released each year. Their combined market cap has grown from $10 billion in 2016, to over $400 billion at the time of writing, having previously been much higher.

Companies involved with blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies and altcoins are expected to experience significant growth over the coming years. Blockchain is the fastest growing market in the world and the Tripterium T50 token offers investors an opportunity to benefit from the growth in value.
